      Our mission is to provide services for medically at risk adults over 18 years of
      age with a variety of medical needs while improving health and quality of life and
      allowing respite and peace of mind for care givers.
      Our goal is to help our participants to
      remain in the lowest level of care possible for as long as possible while avoiding
      unnecessary hospitalizations or institutionalization. This is achieved through the
      provision of a safe, stimulating environment with a comprehensive range of services all
      under one roof.
      </br>
      </br>
      We are licensed by the State of California and are certified as a Medi-Cal provider with
      the California Department of Aging. Our professional staff is here to promote and
      maintain each participant’s highest level of health and independence while providing
      care givers an opportunity to seek work or pursue an active lifestyle outside their home.
      Participants are at the program site from 1-5 days per week, Monday through Friday for
      a minimum of 4 hours per day.
      </br>
      </br>
      We are a non-profit organization located on the Mad River Community Hospital campus.
      While we operate separately from the hospital, our proximity allows convenient access
      to a variety of support services including radiology and laboratory services, the
      emergency room and a number of physician offices.
